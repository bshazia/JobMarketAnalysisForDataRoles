AE Studio: Data Scientist,,"Headquarters: LA office / US remote URL: http://ae.studio We are a development, data science and design studio that works closely with founders and executives to create custom software and machine learning solutions. AE Studio is an LA-based company focused on increasing human agency while maintaining our ineffable culture and whimsy. If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to “eff” it after all. In our Venice CA office and our respective domiciles live a team of highly-skilled developers, data scientists, and dubiously-lucid humorists building agency-increasing products you may recall from such sentences as the one in this paragraph. We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!). More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science and our skunkworks proceeds to support research into cause areas we think are of paramount interest to human beings. We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and now we want to replicate past successes and solve the problem of AI alignment (aligning future powerful systems with human best interests). We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please apply to support our research efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising. Do you have strong problem-solving skills? Do you have a disposition suited for self-management? Have you ever composed a Gilbert and Sullivan parody that would offend Victorian sensibilities? If you can say “yes” to two of those three questions, please apply! ABOUT YOU Fluency in Python–used often, derided occasionally, and considered its eponymous reference to the best of British sketch comedy Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of steak-holders (so projects come out ‘well-done’) Comfort with the statistics and methods deployed in classification problems–that is, the ability to see the random forest for the trees Familiarity with NLP/NLU–even if this posting’s language is a bit unnatural, we suspect you’ll understand our process Experience calling machine learning APIs via REST or client libraries - and determining that their responses lack wit, guile, and tact Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)–or a sound literary understanding of Steve Martin’s “Picasso at the Lapin Agile,” even if you don’t speak French Growth mindset – You had better be funnier after the first 90 days... Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?) Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we’ll even help! Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English. This is a must, our ability to crack jokes in other languages is decidedly de rigeur... BONUS POINTS FOR Experience with self-managed data science projects–show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency or include obscure references! Software development background - We need help with syntax in English too... Experience working with / building / training deep learning-based computer vision or NLP models or LLMs – extra double-secret bonus points for identifying Schroedinger’s cat in a video JavaScript / Node.js experience–require(‘sense of humor’) Clean Code, Unit Tests, Lather, Rinse, Repeat Experience managing clients and client relationships–because, y’know, they pay us... Experience in Startups–because, y’know, we kinda are one, or actually more like several startups all rolled into one! You care about AI alignment, and are optimistic in humanity’s capacity to problem solve and safely navigate accelerating AI capabilities and have an awesome future RECRUITING NOTE There are an increasing number of scammers out there that are taking advantage of our company's name to scam people with fake offers that result in you ultimately giving the scammers money. Please make sure anyone who contacts you is contacting you from the domains ae.studio, agencyenterprise.com, agencyenterprisestudio.com (please make sure that the sender really is from those domains). If you have any questions about any interviews or offers you might have received and seem bogus, please contact recruiting-offers@ae.studio. Equity Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich. At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0. Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer. We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity. * Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do. Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year. Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring right now, but we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

Senior Data Analyst,Zencoder," About Zencoder Zencoder is building the next generation of AI coding agents — advanced tools that supercharge developer workflows and elevate engineering impact. Our mission is to transform how software is built by equipping developers with AI-powered tools that boost productivity, improve code quality, and unlock creativity. Our product integrates seamlessly with JetBrains IDEs and VS Code, helping developers generate, refactor, and repair code. It includes fast and intelligent AI code completion, and our agents can independently perform tasks like running shell commands or searching the web to assist with coding and debugging. We're especially proud of our proprietary Repo Grokking™ technology, which enables our AI agents to deeply understand your entire codebase, providing the strongest contextual understanding on the market. Zencoder also connects with 20+ popular tools like Jira, Sentry, GitHub, and GitLab, making it the most integrated AI coding solution available. This is just a small part of what Zencoder is all about. There’s much more to discover — and we’re just getting started.🛠️ What You’re Getting Into We’re looking for a Senior Data Analyst to help us shape how we collect, analyze, and act on data across our AI-powered coding platform. You’ll build scalable data infrastructure, design high-quality data models, help evaluate our agents, and make sure decision-makers have the insights they need — from engineers to product managers to the founder. You’ll be joining a small but ambitious Data & Analytics team on the ground floor. This is a rare opportunity to set the foundation for analytics at a fast-moving AI company led by serial founder Andrew Filev (ex-Wrike), where your work directly impacts the future of how software is built. 🔍 What You’ll Do Design and run A/B tests that help us move fast without guessing — you'll guide the team in making smart, data-informed choices, and build out best practices for experimentation that everyone can rely on. Develop and implement standardized processes for tracking new analytical events; Turn raw data into real insights — dig into product usage, agent performance, and user behavior to help teams understand what’s working, what’s not, and where to go next. Level up our analytics game by improving our reporting systems and introducing new metrics that reflect how users experience our AI tools. Build trust in our data with robust quality checks and validation processes. Architect DWH data models, create and optimize SQL queries and data models for cross-layer DWH data transformation using DBT. 🧰 Tech Details Our current toolkit includes Amplitude, GCS, BigQuery, DBT, and Python, but we’re not locked in. You’ll help shape the architecture and pick the right tools as we scale. We work with massive, AI-specific data like prompts and user content — not just pageviews and clicks. There’s very little legacy, so you won’t spend your days untangling old pipelines. Instead, you’ll be laying the groundwork for a data platform that powers the future of AI development. 🧠 What You Bring Strong statistical or mathematical background. 5+ years of experience in quantitative analysis, with a focus on evaluating product performance. Hands-on experience designing and analyzing A/B experiments. A passion for data-driven decision making and the ability to answer complex questions through metrics and analytics. Proficiency in SQL, including writing and optimizing complex queries. Understanding of Data Governance and Data Quality processes. Experience creating reports and dashboards using BI tools. Willingness to take on data engineering tasks when needed. 🌟 Nice to Have Experience with AI system analytics and evaluation. Experience building and maintaining data transformation workflows and knowledge of data processing principles (ETL, ELT, Batch, Streaming). Experience in DWH development projects, understanding key approaches and concepts in building analytical data warehouses. Experience with Amplitude. Experience with DBT and BigQuery. 🚀 Why Zencoder?

Remote Friendly: We hire globally and care more about output than timezones. Ownership: Equity included — you’re not just an employee, you’re part of the upside.

AE Studio: Data Scientist,,"Headquarters: LA office / US remote URL: http://ae.studio We are a development, data science and design studio that works closely with founders and executives to create custom software and machine learning solutions. AE Studio is an LA-based company focused on increasing human agency while maintaining our ineffable culture and whimsy. If the work diminishes agency, we may simply decide to “eff” it after all. In our Venice CA office and our respective domiciles live a team of highly-skilled developers, data scientists, and dubiously-lucid humorists building agency-increasing products you may recall from such sentences as the one in this paragraph. We’ve worked with Samsung, Walmart, Berkshire Hathaway, and other large, important entities you’ve probably heard of. Our work environment is fantastic for aspiring coders, calculators, and entrepreneurs. Also, we have neither VC, nor PE, nor other acronyms funding us. We have a weird business model where we sell our work for a profit and use those profits to pay people (I told you it was weird!). More specifically, we deploy the proceeds from our consulting work in development and data science and our skunkworks proceeds to support research into cause areas we think are of paramount interest to human beings. We have made a name for ourselves in cutting-edge brain computer interface (BCI) R&D, and now we want to replicate past successes and solve the problem of AI alignment (aligning future powerful systems with human best interests). We want to optimize for human agency, if you feel similarly, please apply to support our research efforts. Data scientists will have the opportunity between client projects to work on important alignment research, with the opportunity to potentially have your research project prioritized if particularly promising. Do you have strong problem-solving skills? Do you have a disposition suited for self-management? Have you ever composed a Gilbert and Sullivan parody that would offend Victorian sensibilities? If you can say “yes” to two of those three questions, please apply! ABOUT YOU Fluency in Python–used often, derided occasionally, and considered its eponymous reference to the best of British sketch comedy Proven data science experience–primary or equal contributor, multiple smaller projects, management of steak-holders (so projects come out ‘well-done’) Comfort with the statistics and methods deployed in classification problems–that is, the ability to see the random forest for the trees Familiarity with NLP/NLU–even if this posting’s language is a bit unnatural, we suspect you’ll understand our process Experience calling machine learning APIs via REST or client libraries - and determining that their responses lack wit, guile, and tact Agile experience (worked with Kanban, Scrum, Extreme Programming)–or a sound literary understanding of Steve Martin’s “Picasso at the Lapin Agile,” even if you don’t speak French Growth mindset – You had better be funnier after the first 90 days... Willingness to learn our systems (wait, we have systems?) Full-time availability–but if you have cool side projects that increase human agency, we totally want you to keep working on it...we’ll even help! Demonstrated ability to work independently/autonomously Ability to communicate effectively and work exclusively in English. This is a must, our ability to crack jokes in other languages is decidedly de rigeur... BONUS POINTS FOR Experience with self-managed data science projects–show us your cool side hustles, especially if they increase human agency or include obscure references! Software development background - We need help with syntax in English too... Experience working with / building / training deep learning-based computer vision or NLP models or LLMs – extra double-secret bonus points for identifying Schroedinger’s cat in a video JavaScript / Node.js experience–require(‘sense of humor’) Clean Code, Unit Tests, Lather, Rinse, Repeat Experience managing clients and client relationships–because, y’know, they pay us... Experience in Startups–because, y’know, we kinda are one, or actually more like several startups all rolled into one! You care about AI alignment, and are optimistic in humanity’s capacity to problem solve and safely navigate accelerating AI capabilities and have an awesome future RECRUITING NOTE There are an increasing number of scammers out there that are taking advantage of our company's name to scam people with fake offers that result in you ultimately giving the scammers money. Please make sure anyone who contacts you is contacting you from the domains ae.studio, agencyenterprise.com, agencyenterprisestudio.com (please make sure that the sender really is from those domains). If you have any questions about any interviews or offers you might have received and seem bogus, please contact recruiting-offers@ae.studio. Equity Working at AE means receiving equity in some of our client projects and in the Skunkworks projects we incubate. The equity granted is priced at a value of $0 when you receive it. If it were otherwise, you’d be forced to pay taxes. But to be clear, there are no free lunches, only the choice of who pays for your sandwich. At AE, the equity you receive is not free to AE. We invest millions annually in Skunkworks projects - paying our employees to build technology for which no client pays a bill. We receive equity from certain clients, which means we accept less in terms of our billable rate. We then pass that equity on to our employees. Sure it’s priced at $0 on day 1 - a call option on a stock trading at $100 with a strike price of $100 is priced at $0 today for tax purposes, but you’d want to receive that option. If you received that option on a dozen stocks, you’d be fairly confident that some of them would be worth a lot more than $0. Offering this equity (by investing in Skunkworks or offering clients a lower rate) comes out of AE’s margins. Theoretically, we should be lowering salaries to compensate. But we’re competitive on that front as well. Over the long-term, we believe AE employees who stick around are likely to fare extremely well monetarily (no legal promises). We think long-term. You should too when you choose your employer. We are looking to hire people who think long term. People create exponentially more value here in their 3rd or 4th year rather than their 1st or 2nd, and that only increases. The value you create leads to more equity issued every year, and you retain it while you remain at AE or at a Skunkworks co that spins out, in order to free up equity for others, which is how we afford to be generous with the equity. * Disclaimer: If you leave AE on good terms, you can retain 20% of your equity if you continue to send leads our way, share our core values, etc. If you leave AE for your own AE-incubated Skunkworks project (or someone else’s), you retain 100% of your equity. Folks create exponentially more value here in their 3rd and 4th years than their 1st or 2nd - we want folks who think long-term like we do. Salary range from $120k/year to $220k/year. Not in the range? That's fine, you can still apply and our team may fit you in a more senior position that we're not actively hiring right now, but we are growing fast and may have other openings soon.

Further, while employees of Headspace (formerly Ginger) cannot access Headspace products/services, they will be offered benefits according to the company s benefit plan. To ensure we are adhering to best practice and ethical guidelines in the field of mental health, we take care to avoid dual relationships. A dual relationship occurs when a mental health care provider has a second, significantly different relationship with their client in addition to the traditional client-therapist relationship—including, for example, a managerial relationship. As such, Headspace requests that individuals who have received coaching or clinical services at Headspace wait until their care with Headspace is complete before applying for a position. If someone with a Headspace account is hired for a position, please note their account will be deactivated and they will not be able to use Headspace services for the duration of their employment. Further, if Headspace cannot find a role that fails to resolve an ethical issue associated with a dual relationship, Headspace may need to take steps to ensure ethical obligations are being adhered to, including a delayed start date or a potential leave of absence. Such steps would be taken to protect both the former member, as well as any relevant individuals from their care team, from impairment, risk of exploitation, or harm.",https://jobicy.com/jobs/117801-senior-data-engineer-11,2025-05-20T06:20:57+00:00,USA
